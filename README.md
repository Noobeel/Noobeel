## About Me
<p>
Welcome to my GitHub profile!

I am a passionate and detail-oriented Junior Software Engineer with a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science (Honors) from Toronto Metropolitan University (formerly Ryerson University).

I have a strong foundation in various programming languages including Python, JavaScript, and TypeScript, and am well-versed in frameworks such as React.js, Next.js, and Django. My hands-on experience ranges from developing high-performance web applications to optimizing system performance in professional settings. Notable projects include a portfolio website leveraging Next.js and TypeScript, a task management tool built with Python and React.js, and a document search engine using advanced NLP techniques.

Actively seeking **full-time Software Engineering/Development** roles within Canada. Feel free to reach out to discuss potential opportunities!
